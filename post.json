  "conent": "If I were to eat 3 loaves of bread, one from Egypt in the year 2200BC, one from Rome in the year 45BC, and one from England in the year 1100AD, how much different would each one be to the modern day and/or to each other?"

  "conent": "Why was the Church of Scientology officially recognized as a religion in America, even though it committed numerous criminal acts including infiltration and espionage toward the Federal government? The Church of Scientology, or at least individuals acting in the name of it, committed a number of bad acts prior to being given recognition as a religion so why were they still rewarded? And why weren't they treated as a terrorist organiation?"

  "conent": "The Rubik's cube was invented in Hungary in 1974. Tetris was created in 1984 in Moscow. Was there something about Eastern bloc culture in that era that made spatial puzzles particularly appealing? Also how were they marketed in Communist countries and how were they popularized in the West?"

  "conent": "In the book(and movie) Tyler goes on an extended monologue about the origin of
soap in Indian burial pyres.
I can't find the passage from the book, but here's the scene from the movie courtesy of IMDB:
Tyler Durden: Now, ancient people found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. You know why?
Narrator: No.
Tyler Durden: Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burnt, water speeded through the wood ashes to create lye. [holds up a bottle]
Tyler Durden: This is lye - the crucial ingredient. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. May I see your hand, please?
[Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet - he takes the Narrator's hand and kisses the back of it]
Narrator: What is this? Tyler Durden: This... [pours the lye on the Narrator's hand]
Tyler Durden: ... is chemical burn."

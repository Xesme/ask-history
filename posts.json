    "content": "Why was the Church of Scientology officially recognized as a religion in America, even though it committed numerous criminal acts including infiltration and espionage toward the Federal government? The Church of Scientology, or at least individuals acting in the name of it, committed a number of bad acts prior to being given recognition as a religion so why were they still rewarded? And why weren't they treated as a terrorist organiation?"

    "content": "The Rubik's cube was invented in Hungary in 1974. Tetris was created in 1984 in Moscow. Was there something about Eastern bloc culture in that era that made spatial puzzles particularly appealing? Also how were they marketed in Communist countries and how were they popularized in the West?"

      "comment": "The rise of technical intelligentsia can be seem in the USSR from about the 60s, and yes, much of the culture of that period was centered around that class of people â€” biologists, engineers, scientists, etc.There were two reasons of this. First, it was state-approved after a decade of the space race, the Cold War, the general theme of rebuilding after WWII, getting ahead of the West, etc. The second reason was that the literary culture and the arts couldnt compete for a while because most of the major writers either died in the purges, or in the war, or were spending their time in the camps. There were very few people still writing the good stuff, compared to the -Silver Age- 30 years back. Which created a cultural vacuum of sorts, and it had to be filled."

      "comment": "I'm not a real historian, just a history teacher, but I think I can kind of answer this. When America was first born there was a strong thought among the founding fathers to not go abroad looking for monsters to slay. A major part of their independence relied on them not getting involved with foreign affairs. As part of separating from Europe was separating from their problems as well. Now there were a lot of American citizens that wanted to return the favor to France and fight the British. Especially because Britain had been stirring up trouble with the Native Americans in an effort to destroy the new country and regain the territory back. But it would have been a pointless fight. America didn't have nearly a good enough navy to send troops over to Europe in any meaningful way and it would have just provoked a much more powerful nation to attack them once again."
